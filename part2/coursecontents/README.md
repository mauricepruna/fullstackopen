Exercises 2.1.-2.5.
The exercises are submitted via GitHub, and by marking the exercises as done in the submission system.

You can submit all of the exercises into the same repository, or use multiple different repositories. If you submit exercises from different parts into the same repository, name your directories well.

The exercises are submitted One part at a time. When you have submitted the exercises for a part, you can no longer submit any missed exercises for that part.

Note that this part has more exercises than the ones before, so do not submit until you have done all the exercises from this part you want to submit.

2.1: Course information step6
Let's finish the code for rendering course contents from exercises 1.1 - 1.5. You can start with the code from the model answers. The model answers for part 1 can be found by going to the submission system, clicking on my submissions at the top, and in the row corresponding to part 1 under the solutions column clicking on show. To see the solution to the course info exercise, click on index.js under kurssitiedot ("kurssitiedot" means "course info").

Note that if you copy a project from one place to another, you might have to delete the node_modules directory and install the dependencies again with the command npm install before you can start the application.

Generally, it's not recommended that you copy a project's whole contents and/or add the node_modules directory to the version control system.

Let's change the App component like so:

const App = () => {
const course = {
id: 1,
name: 'Half Stack application development',
parts: [
{
name: 'Fundamentals of React',
exercises: 10,
id: 1
},
{
name: 'Using props to pass data',
exercises: 7,
id: 2
},
{
name: 'State of a component',
exercises: 14,
id: 3
}
]
}

return <Course course={course} />
}

export default Appcopy
Define a component responsible for formatting a single course called Course.

The component structure of the application can be, for example, the following:

App
Course
Header
Content
Part
Part
...
copy
Hence, the Course component contains the components defined in the previous part, which are responsible for rendering the course name and its parts.

The rendered page can, for example, look as follows:

You don't need the sum of the exercises yet.

The application must work regardless of the number of parts a course has, so make sure the application works if you add or remove parts of a course.

Ensure that the console shows no errors!

2.2: Course information step7
Show also the sum of the exercises of the course.

sum of exercises added feature
2.3\*: Course information step8
If you haven't done so already, calculate the sum of exercises with the array method reduce.

Pro tip: when your code looks as follows:

const total =
parts.reduce((s, p) => someMagicHere)copy
and does not work, it's worth it to use console.log, which requires the arrow function to be written in its longer form:

const total = parts.reduce((s, p) => {
console.log('what is happening', s, p)
return someMagicHere
})copy
Not working? : Use your search engine to look up how reduce is used in an Object Array.

2.4: Course information step9
Let's extend our application to allow for an arbitrary number of courses:

const App = () => {
const courses = [
{
name: 'Half Stack application development',
id: 1,
parts: [
{
name: 'Fundamentals of React',
exercises: 10,
id: 1
},
{
name: 'Using props to pass data',
exercises: 7,
id: 2
},
{
name: 'State of a component',
exercises: 14,
id: 3
},
{
name: 'Redux',
exercises: 11,
id: 4
}
]
},
{
name: 'Node.js',
id: 2,
parts: [
{
name: 'Routing',
exercises: 3,
id: 1
},
{
name: 'Middlewares',
exercises: 7,
id: 2
}
]
}
]

return (
<div>
// ...
</div>
)
}copy
The application can, for example, look like this:

arbitrary number of courses feature add-on
2.5: separate module
Declare the Course component as a separate module, which is imported by the App component. You can include all subcomponents of the course in the same module.
